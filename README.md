# Hacktoberfest-animations

Small animation selector for Hacktoberfest

## How to contribute
- Fork this repo
- Create a new file with your cool animation name inside `./animations` folder, be creative!
- Edit the `./animations.js` file to include your animation using the following structure:
```json
{
    name: 'the-name-of-your-animation',
    author: 'your-github-username
}
```
<sub>**PS**: the animation name should have the same name of your CSS file.</sub><br>
<sub>**PS²**: you do not need to include your object respecting the alphabetical order, there is a function that will do this automatically afterwards.</sub><br>
<sub>**PS³**: use the same name of your CSS file as your animation class. Example: a file named `my-cool-animation.css` containing a `.my-cool-animation` class inside.</sub>
- DONE!

If you have any problems/questions or issues please submit an issue and I will get to you!
