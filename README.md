# Hacktoberfest-animations

Small animation selector for Hacktoberfest

## How to contribute
Fork this repo


Add a new `option` to the `select` element.

The `value` for the option should be something that describes the animation.

Include a link to your Github by using the `data-link` attribute.

The text that goes inside should follow this format `animationname - username`.

Then you can create any animation you want using CSS! Place the CSS and keyframes for your animation in the `animations.css` file. If you get stuck or are unsure about the style of the code, check out the examples already included.
